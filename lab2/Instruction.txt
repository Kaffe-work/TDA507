create files 1CDH.domak and 1CDH.pairs
(touch works)
Compile DOMAK.java and MakeMap.java
Run DOMAK/MakeMap
wish dotplot.ctl 1CDH.pairs for task 1. The image is small, but usable. alternativly, use the same method as for task 2:
use Xclip -sel c < 1CDH.domak to get the contents from 1CDH.domak and paste this into 
https://www.meta-chart.com/scatter#/display

This site will generate a nice-looking dotplot for task 2.
